asm2(0x7, 0x18)

[ebp+8] = 0x18
[ebp+12] = 0x7

Steps:
• [ebp-4] = [ebp+12] (0x7)
• [ebp-8] = [ebp+8] (0x18)
• While [ebp-8] is less than 0x3937:
  • [ebp-4] += 1
  • [ebp-8] += 0xcc
• eax = [ebp-4]
• Return eax

Flag: 0x4f

Python script
=============
a, b = 7, 24
while b < 0x3937:
	a += 1
	b += 0xcc
print(hex(a))
